## Planning and Development Process

- Due to limitations of free API calls, not able to have a stock screening application
- As we need 1 API call for 1 stock and US market has thousand of stocks. Hence not feasible



## User Stories

As for now, there are 4 categories for Dashboard  area:-

```
- Most Actives - 1 API call
- Top Gainers - 1 API call
- Top Losers - 1 API call
- Watchlist - Each stock 1 API call 
```

- Click on the category item, will list the stocks at the Stock Listing Section Column
- Clicking on stock symbol will bring up the stock chart
- Click '+' icon to add to watchlist
- Click 'i' icon for company info
- Watchlist readme from firebase real-time DB
- At the header, enter a stock symbol, click on 'Add to watch' to add to watch list
- click on 'view' to view the chart or view the news depending on which main page you are in 


As for news page:-
- enter symbol and click view will display 5 news 
- click on news details will bring you to the news website


## Chart 

- Candlestick chart with 20/50 EMA. 
- Daily and Weekly selection
  - Single candle represent daily or wekkly
- Full stochastics indicator (Green line is fast and pink line is slow)
- Volume bar



## Problem-Solving Strategy

- React router param for chart and news
- useEffect and fetch() method for API request. Will trigger re-render and API request when param or state change
- For wathclist, using promise.all. One API call for each stock
- WindowWidth event listener to resize the chart according
- CSS @media and grid col to resize the column according to window width 



## Unsolved problems / Further development

- Real-time chart. Inorporate latest data into chart
- Real-time data for watchlist or a button click to update latest price
- Additional Category e.g. Index, Crypto
